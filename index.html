    <p><h2>Things we can do.</h2></p>
    <h4>Go to Kansai Cycling Center</h4>
    <p>This could be fun, maybe a little bit juvenile but Lisa would have a good time I think.</p>
    <h4>Go to Tomogashima</h4>
    <p>We couldn't go last time due to rough seas, I still have never been</p>
    <h4>Play<em><strong>"butt games"</strong></em></h4>
    <p>bury the <em><strong>garden snake</em></strong></em> is my favorite variant.</p>
